# Homegrown: Sunlit Valley
**Homegrown: Sunlit Valley** is a moderately edited fork of the [Society: Sunlit Valley](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/society-sunlit-valley) modpack. A farming commerce Minecraft modpack in the style of games like Stardew Valley and Harvest moon. As you progress, you'll use coins to purchase new items, upgrade your gear, and gain tools to make money even faster.

### Issues
Issues on the Homegrown server should only be reported directly to me, Mnesikos, in the Purpura Skies discord server. I will forward them as needed after ensuring they are not directly an issue with the Homegrown edits.
